Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning Project

ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project is part of an AI & ML internship task to clean and prepare the Titanic dataset for machine learning.

ðŸ“‚ Included Files
1. `Titanic_Preprocessing.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook with all steps
2. `Titanic-Dataset (3).csv` â€“ Raw dataset used for cleaning

ðŸ”§ What I Did
1. Filled missing values (Age, Embarked)
2. Removed unnecessary columns (Cabin, Name, Ticket)
3. Converted categorical columns to numbers (Sex, Embarked)
4. Scaled numeric features (Age, Fare)
5. Detected and removed outliers in Fare

ðŸ›  Tools Used
1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy
3. Seaborn, Matplotlib
4. scikit-learn

âœ… Final Result
The dataset is now clean, numeric, and ready for machine learning.
